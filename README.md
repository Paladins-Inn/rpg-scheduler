# RPG-SCHEDULER - A plan is what, a schedule is when. It takes both a plan and a schedule to get things done.

## Abstract
This is a system for scheduling RPG sessions. It may be used for other session topics too, of course.


## License
The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer. 


## Architecture

tl;dr (ok, only the bullshit bingo words):
- Immutable Objects
- Relying heavily on generated code
- 100 % test coverage of human generated code
- Every line of code not written is bug free!

Code test coverage for human generated code should be 100%, machinge generated code is considered bugfree until proven 
wrong. But every line that needs not be written is a bug free line without need to test it. So aim for not writing code.


## A note from the author
If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up. I'm open for that. But be warned: I want to do it 
_right_. So no short cuts to get faster. And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software 
design :-).
